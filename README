INTRODUCTION

  XXX TODO

  See the POD documentation for complete details, features, and usage.


INSTALLATION

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
  type the following commands:

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install

  You'll probably need to do the last as root.  If instead you wish to
  install the module by hand, simply copy it into a directory named Term in
  your Perl library directory.
